steamcmd setup

After setting up a few different steam servers, I felt that it became a bit time intensive to manually download the files and packages onto a server to host a server such as Garrysmod. 

However, at the same time, I didn't want a control panel that may be intensive so this project will be going through and using python and steamcmd together. 

If you have any issues though or suggestions please feel free to let me know in the issues page!
